# crudex
Don't make an api for just a crud anymore.

## Status:
This is just an idea. There is no alpha version yet.

### The idea: 
A crud creator and exposer to make fast APIs for every single application. 

### The way: 
1. A crud creator, accessible via internal functions. 
2. An api manager, with a total enpoint controll. 
3. An ACL system, who connects the API with the crud, and allow or not to operations.

### The dream:
Create all the backend with a simple panel, who can also monitorize it all, auto scale and is plugin friendly.

 - To the [Pillars](https://github.com/pillarsjs) team ([bifuer](https://github.com/bifuer) and [lilxelo](https://github.com/lilxelo)), who developed the [server side of Crudex](https://github.com/pillarsjs/pillars), and created in my mind the idea of on demand js generation.
 - To [Ulises Gasc√≥n](https://github.com/ulisesgascon) and all the [GoblinDB](https://github.com/GoblinDBRocks) contributors, who made the demo possible.
 - To [Josheriff](https://github.com/josheriff), who spammed me with "auto-generated backend" ideas all the time.
 - To my cat, Opie, for not killing me while talking him about all the doubts I had developing this.
