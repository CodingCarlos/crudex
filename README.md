# crudex
Don't make an api for just a crud anymore.

## Status:
This is just an idea. There is no alpha version yet.

### The idea: 
A crud creator and exposer to make fast APIs for every single application. 

### The way: 
1. A crud creator, accessible via internal functions. 
2. An api manager, with a total enpoint controll. 
3. An ACL system, who connects the API with the crud, and allow or not to operations.

### The dream:
Create all the backend with a simple panel, who can also monitorize it all, auto scale and is plugin friendly.
